# animalProject

AnimalProject is a simple demonstration using object oriented programming. 
Basically it is a class structure to represent three animals, a cat, a dog, and a duck. 

Where all animals can walk. 

The animals each make a sound, but they are different. There should be a required common method to make the sound. 

The cat makes a meow sound 
The dog makes a bark sound 
The duck makes a quack sound 

Included is my database class that I use for most of my projects.
