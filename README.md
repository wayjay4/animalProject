# animalProject

AnimalProject is a simple demonstration using object oriented programming. 
Basically it is a class structure to represent three animals, a cat, a dog, and a duck. 

Where all animals can walk. 

The animals each make a sound, but they are different. There should be a required common method to make the sound. 

The cat makes a meow sound 
The dog makes a bark sound 
The duck makes a quack sound 

A live sample of animal_class can be found at: http://waylondixon.com/workbench.php.

# database_class file
The file database_class is a sample of my code that I am proudest about. It has been used for most of my projects.
